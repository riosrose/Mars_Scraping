# DataCollection-challenge
Module 11 Mars scraping Challenge
UCB Data Analytics-Challenge 11

CHALLENGE PURPOSE : In this challenge, work will demonstrate: 
 - full web-scraping and data analysis
 - identification of HTML elements on a web page
 - identification of their id and class attributes
 - knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup
 - scraping various types of information, including HTML tables and recurring elements

As you work on this Challenge, remember that you’re strengthening the same core skills that you’ve been developing until now: collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and then visually communicating your insights.
